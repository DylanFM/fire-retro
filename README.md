# Incidents review

## [review.bushfir.es](http://review.bushfir.es/)

This is a small client-side app displaying a visualisation of RFS incidents over 2015. All the data is requested live from a [GeoJSON API](https://github.com/DylanFM/bushfires) I've built to manage this data in near-real time.

Beneath the hood it makes use of Virtual DOM, Turf, d3 and Leaflet.

The dates in the code can be changed to display data from late 2013 until today, but I've left it at 2015 for now.
